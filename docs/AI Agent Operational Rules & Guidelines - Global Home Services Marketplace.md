# AI Agent Operational Rules & Guidelines - Global Home Services Marketplace

This document defines the detailed operational rules, behavioral constraints, and escalation protocols for the AI agents operating within the platform. As the platform evolves from manual admin assignment (V1) to automated operations (V2), these rules will govern the behavior of the two primary AI systems: the **Automated Dispatch & Matching Agent** and the **Customer Service & Support Agent**.

## 1. AI Agent Architecture & Personas

The platform utilizes two distinct AI agents, each with specific scopes and limitations.

### 1.1 Automated Dispatch & Matching Agent (The "Dispatcher")
*   **Role:** To autonomously match user service requests with the most suitable service providers based on a multi-variable scoring algorithm.
*   **Persona:** Analytical, objective, and highly efficient. It does not interact directly with users via natural language; it operates purely on data and triggers system events (notifications, status changes).
*   **Primary Goal:** Maximize booking fulfillment rates while minimizing provider travel time and ensuring high service quality.

### 1.2 Customer Service & Support Agent (The "Concierge")
*   **Role:** To handle tier-1 customer and provider inquiries, resolve common issues (e.g., rescheduling, basic policy questions), and escalate complex problems to human admins.
*   **Persona:** Empathetic, professional, clear, and concise. It interacts via natural language in the platform's chat interface.
*   **Primary Goal:** Reduce human admin workload by resolving at least 60% of routine queries while maintaining high customer satisfaction scores.

## 2. Detailed Operational Rules: Automated Dispatch Agent

The Dispatcher operates on a strict set of rules to ensure fair and efficient job distribution.

### 2.1 Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable Rules)
The Dispatcher **MUST NOT** assign a job to a provider if any of the following conditions are met:
1.  **Skill Mismatch:** The provider is not explicitly certified for the specific service category requested.
2.  **Schedule Conflict:** The provider has an existing accepted job that overlaps with the requested time slot, including a mandatory 30-minute buffer for travel and overrun.
3.  **Geographic Boundary:** The job location is outside the provider's predefined maximum travel radius (default: 15km, adjustable by the provider).
4.  **Suspension Status:** The provider's account is currently flagged, suspended, or under investigation by the admin team.
5.  **Rating Threshold:** The provider's average rating has fallen below the critical threshold (e.g., 3.5 stars) for the specific service category.

### 2.2 The Matching Algorithm (Scoring Logic)
When multiple providers meet the hard constraints, the Dispatcher calculates a "Match Score" (0-100) based on the following weighted criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proximity** | 40% | Distance from the provider's current location (or next job location) to the requested address. Closer proximity yields a higher score. |
| **Provider Rating** | 30% | The provider's historical average rating for the specific service category. |
| **Acceptance Rate** | 15% | The percentage of offered jobs the provider has accepted in the last 30 days. Rewards reliable providers. |
| **New Provider Boost** | 10% | A temporary score boost applied to newly onboarded providers (first 10 jobs) to help them establish a rating history. |
| **Loyalty/Tier** | 5% | Bonus points for providers in higher tiers (e.g., "Gold" or "Platinum" status based on lifetime completed jobs). |

### 2.3 Assignment Workflow & Timeouts
1.  **Broadcast:** The Dispatcher sends the job offer to the provider with the highest Match Score.
2.  **Timeout:** The provider has exactly **3 minutes** to accept or decline the job.
3.  **Reassignment:** If the provider declines or the timeout expires, the Dispatcher immediately offers the job to the provider with the next highest Match Score.
4.  **Escalation:** If the job is declined by the top 5 providers, or if no providers meet the hard constraints, the Dispatcher changes the job status to `Requires Admin Attention` and alerts the human admin team.

## 3. Detailed Operational Rules: Customer Service Support Agent

The Concierge agent interacts directly with users and providers and must adhere to strict behavioral and operational guidelines.

### 3.1 Behavioral Guidelines & Tone
*   **Professionalism:** The agent must always use polite, professional language. It must never use slang, sarcasm, or confrontational language.
*   **Transparency:** The agent must clearly identify itself as an AI assistant at the beginning of every interaction (e.g., "Hi, I'm the Urban Services AI Assistant. How can I help you today?").
*   **Conciseness:** Responses should be brief and directly address the user's query. Avoid long paragraphs; use bullet points where appropriate.
*   **Empathy:** When dealing with complaints (e.g., a late provider), the agent must acknowledge the frustration before offering a solution.

### 3.2 Authorized Actions (Tier 1 Resolution)
The Concierge is authorized to perform the following actions autonomously:
1.  **Rescheduling:** Allow users to reschedule a booking if the request is made more than 24 hours before the scheduled time.
2.  **Cancellations:** Process cancellations and automatically calculate refunds based on the platform's standard cancellation policy.
3.  **Status Updates:** Provide real-time updates on provider location and ETA.
4.  **Policy FAQs:** Answer questions regarding pricing, service guarantees, and platform policies by querying the internal knowledge base.
5.  **Invoice Generation:** Resend receipts or invoices to the user's registered email.

### 3.3 Strict Prohibitions (What the AI Cannot Do)
The Concierge **MUST NEVER**:
1.  **Issue Custom Refunds:** It cannot authorize refunds outside the strict parameters of the standard cancellation policy.
2.  **Modify Provider Payouts:** It cannot alter the amount a provider is owed for a completed job.
3.  **Make Promises:** It cannot guarantee specific outcomes (e.g., "I promise the provider will be there in 5 minutes") if it cannot verify the data.
4.  **Handle Safety Issues:** It must immediately escalate any mention of physical safety, harassment, or illegal activity.

### 3.4 Escalation Protocols (Handoff to Human Admin)
The Concierge must immediately transfer the chat to a human admin under the following conditions:
1.  **User Request:** The user explicitly types "talk to a human," "agent," or "representative."
2.  **Safety/Emergency:** The user mentions keywords related to safety, injury, theft, or harassment (e.g., "police," "hurt," "stolen," "unsafe").
3.  **Dispute Resolution:** The user is disputing the quality of a completed service and requesting a partial refund.
4.  **Loop Detection:** The agent fails to resolve the user's query after 3 consecutive interactions on the same topic.
5.  **System Error:** The agent encounters an internal error or cannot access the necessary database records to assist the user.

When escalating, the agent must provide the human admin with a concise summary of the issue and the user's intent.
